added demo funcs which demonstrate various scenarios
	TODO: not sure why agent explodes with critical damping.
	TODO: why are trajectories smoother when undamped?
	TODO: ask Rich about why my lognormal fit is off.
added wall force fields based on position and velocity. In particular, repulsive forces as a function of how close it is to the wall and it's speed towards the wall. So, if the agent is flying near the wall but not towards it, it won't be repulsed.
consolidating, modularizing plotting funcs
