added demo funcs which demonstrate various scenarios
	TODO: not sure why agent explodes with critical damping.
	TODO: why are trajectories smoother when undamped?
	TODO: ask Rich about why my lognormal fit is off.
added wall force fields based on position and velocity. In particular, repulsive forces as a function of how close it is to the wall and it's speed towards the wall. So, if the agent is flying near the wall but not towards it, it won't be repulsed.
consolidating, modularizing plotting funcs

position heat maps are working!
	made monochromatic
	hot cells are drowning out
	velocity isnâ€™t actually cancelled
	mosquitos getting stuck on walls
assumption: all mosquitos weigh the same
new coordinates convention adopted, made new cartoons
new pretty plotting package
removed damping to reach walls.
fixed hists
plotting Dickinson data for comparison
flipped y axis
made r0 randomized
implemented bouncing
	less wall following.
	velo dist is pointy. accel is not recalculated

major overhauls to the code mechanics. trajectories are now class objects.
set k=0. now that spring is gone, driving forces are stronger.
changed f0 into 2D double-exponential/Laplace distribution
changed wf0 into constant upstream push as per Rich	
implemented heatmaps!
made simple wall forcefield
