Sweet new class system
Sweet new Pandas dataframes
Got plume data in a plume class
        -get_temp() method
Everytime I run any figure, saves figures automatically and embeds the parameters into the fname
Excluding downwind and upwind-most parts from analysis due to camera z uncertainty.
Violin plots
Compass plots


Sanity checks + lifesaving features
e.g. all figures are automatically saved w/ parameters embedded in the filename
segregated functions into scripts based on category (I/O, plotting , math, etc)


flag for repulsion type
make plots with center repulsion, w/o, and with trenches

full, down/upwind, quarters plots

finished repulsion landscape-based Forces. 
	TODO: fit the forces to Sharri distributions

fitted lognormal to Dickinson accelerations. Switched random driving force from 2D radially symmetric exponentially decay distribution to 2D radially symmetric lognormal distribution (see 2D histogram). refit the parameters so that acceleration distributions match Dickinson accelerations.
started porting wall repulsion forces into a repulsion landscape

4/13/15

added demo funcs which demonstrate various scenarios
	TODO: not sure why agent explodes with critical damping.
	TODO: why are trajectories smoother when undamped?
added wall force fields based on position and velocity. In particular, repulsive forces as a function of how close it is to the wall and it's speed towards the wall. So, if the agent is flying near the wall but not towards it, it won't be repulsed.
consolidating, modularizing plotting funcs

4/6/15
position heat maps are working!
	made monochromatic
	hot cells are drowning out
	velocity isnâ€™t actually cancelled
	mosquitos getting stuck on walls
assumption: all mosquitos weigh the same
new coordinates convention adopted, made new cartoons
new pretty plotting package
removed damping to reach walls.
fixed hists
plotting Dickinson data for comparison
flipped y axis
made r0 randomized
implemented bouncing
	less wall following.
	velo dist is pointy. accel is not recalculated

4/1/15
major overhauls to the code mechanics. trajectories are now class objects.
set k=0. now that spring is gone, driving forces are stronger.
changed f0 into 2D double-exponential/Laplace distribution
changed wf0 into constant upstream push as per Rich	
implemented heatmaps!
made simple wall forcefield
