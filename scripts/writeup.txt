Introduction

Mosquitos, in their quest to find a blood meal, explore their environment to detect sparse stimuli. One modality mosquitos use are temperature plumes. However, which features of the temperature environment are being used to make decisions is unknown. 

We model our agent as a driven, damped dynamical system which has been fit to capture certain aspects of mosquito flight characteristics (speed, acceleration, positional distributions). The agent navigates a spatially varying thermal field, which were are experimentally determined time-averaged data from our wind tunnel

The agent is modelled as a point in euclidean space whose movements are governed by a set of parametric equations:

(1) F = -beta*v + F_rf + F_wtf

where F is our time-varying force, beta is our damping coefficient, F_rf is our random driving force, and F_wtf is our upwind bias driving force. 

Explanation of forces

The first is a upwind bias force. The second is a radially symmetric, random force.

Wall collisions.

We have constrained our agent to fly within the bounds of our virtual wind tunnel. As the agent approaches the boundary, we apply a wall repulsion force that is proportional to the agent's velocity component in the direction of the wall. Thus, if the agent is near the wall but is not flying towards it, there won't be a repulsive force.

Simulation

With this model, we can alter our parameters. The trials were run with the following conditions:

1. Initial positions- randomly selected inside the bounds of the cage.

2. Initial velocity: drawn from a gaussian.
